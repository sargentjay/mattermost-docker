# This file allows you to run mattermost within your docker swarm mode cluster
# for more informations check: https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/
#
# Simply run:
#
# `docker stack up [STACK NAME] -c docker-stack.yml`
# 
# In this case `mm` is going to be stack name, so the command will be:
#
# `docker stack up mm -c docker-stack.yml`
#
# From now on all the services that belong to this stack will be prefixed with `mm_`
# this file defines 3 services, these are going to be mm_db, mm_app and mm_web,
# each of these names is the service's hostname as well, they can communicate 
# with each other easily by using the hostname instead of the ip or exposing ports to the host.
#
# As a side note, images tagged as latest are pulled by default, 
# that means there's no need to use `image:latest`
#
# use latest compose v3.3 file format for optimal compatibility with latest docker release and swarm features.
# see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-3
# and https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-33
